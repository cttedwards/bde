Models are defined as:

Y/0: Year covariate
A/0: Area covariate
M/0: Method covariate
C/0: Vessel category covariate

D/0: Disjunct area definitions (i.e. whether sampling/prediction areas are the same as estimation areas)
I/0: Interaction between area and year effects
H/0: Hierarchical model structure indicating whether the log-normal observation uncertainty is estimated or fixed.
